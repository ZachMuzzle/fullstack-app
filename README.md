# Fullstack App

## How to get Started

* I am following the process of creating a fullstack app with nodejs/express from this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrj9AohVhPA)
* I stopped @46.18 minute mark (I might need to review)

### Issues
- When adding name error occurs through backend.
- I have tested with another function and inserting sql works with **newName** function.
- **insertNewName** does not seem to be working. Some issue with insertId (not sure) 
- Next step for testing needs to be testing similar to **insertNewName**, but use **newName** as a test dummy. So `resolve(results.response)` for **newName**.
