# Fullstack App

## How to get Started

* I am following the process of creating a fullstack app with nodejs/express from this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrj9AohVhPA)
* Completed on 01/19/23

### Things to maybe add
- ~~Update date for every updated item.~~
- ~~Delete/Truncate all the data button.~~
- ~~Refresh site on name added.~~

### Features Completed

- Search bar Functionality
    - I added the ability search for a name by using a search bar. This will check through the database for the given name. Then highlight given name.

- Checking Feature 
    - I added a feature to check and make sure before a name is added to the database if it already exists. If this is true the name is not added or edited into the database.

- New Alert Message
    - A new alert message was added to show if a duplicate name was entered or blank name was entered. Now a pretty modal will show instead of the basic `alert()` type of message shown.

- CSS Background and Buttons Change 
    - To make the webpage more pretty looking I added blueish backgrounds. As well Colored buttons and highlight areas when hovered over.
